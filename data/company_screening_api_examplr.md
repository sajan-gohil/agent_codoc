**Note**:

1. You need to provide the following
    1. `$auth_token` : Your Crustdata API Key/Auth Token. Reach out to abhilash@crustdata.com through your company email if not available
    2. `$metric_name` : could be any of the following
        1. *linkedin_headcount_and_glassdoor_ceo_approval_and_g2*
2. To retrieve all the companies matching the filters, keep iterating over `offset` field in the payload. 
3. **Do not** increase `count` beyond 100 as the result will be truncated to 100 rows without any ordering.

**Note**:

1. You need to provide the following
    1. `$auth_token` : Your Crustdata API Key/Auth Token. Reach out to abhilash@crustdata.com through your company email if not available
2. To retrieve all the companies matching the filters, keep iterating over `offset` field in the payload. 
3. **Do not** increase `count` beyond 100 as the result will be truncated to 100 rows without any ordering.
